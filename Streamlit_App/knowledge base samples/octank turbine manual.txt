# Octank Wind Turbine Technician Handbook

## Overview

This handbook provides detailed technical information, troubleshooting procedures, and maintenance instructions for Octank wind turbines. It is intended for use by trained wind turbine technicians. 

Safety is the top priority when working on turbines. All applicable company and regulatory safety protocols must be followed at all times. This includes proper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), lockout/tagout procedures, working at heights safety, and other precautions.

## Wind Turbine System Overview

Octank wind turbines consist of the following major components:

- **Rotor Blades** - The aerodynamic blades that capture wind energy and rotate the rotor hub.
- **Rotor Hub & Pitch Bearings** - The hub that the blades attach to and pitching mechanisms to control blade angles.
- **Main Shaft & Main Bearing** - The main rotating shaft that the rotor hub attaches to and the main bearing it rotates within. 
- **Gearbox** - Increases the rotational speeds from the main shaft to the generator.
- **Generator** - Converts the rotational energy into electrical energy.
- **Yaw System** - Rotates the nacelle to face the rotor into the wind.
- **Tower** - The vertical tower structure that supports the nacelle and rotor.
- **Control Systems** - Computer controls, sensors, and hydraulic systems.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Below are some common issues with Octank turbines and the procedures for troubleshooting and repair:

### Generator Not Producing Power
1. Check generator electrical output on the controller. If no output, proceed to next step.
2. Check generator sensor data - temperature, RPMs, etc. Abnormal readings may indicate a fault.
3. Shutdown turbine and perform visual inspection of generator for damage.
4. If damage is found, submit work order to replace generator components as needed.
5. If no damage, run generator diagnostic software and repair per the results.

### Abnormal Gearbox Temperature/Noise
1. Check gearbox temperature and noise sensors on the controller. 
2. If overtemp or high noise, shutdown turbine immediately to prevent damage.
3. Perform a gearbox oil analysis to check for metal shavings and lubrication quality.
4. If oil is contaminated or depleted, drain gearbox and replace with new lubricant.
5. If gear damage is suspected from analysis, submit work order to replace gearbox components.

### Pitch System Fault
1. Check pitch system hydraulic pressure. Low pressure indicates leak or problem.
2. Inspect pitch motors and actuators for leaks, damage, or obstructions.
3. Check pitch motor sensors and wiring for faults.
4. Run pitch system diagnostics to isolate issue to components.
5. Replace failed components - motors, actuators, pumps, valves, etc.

### Yaw System Fault
1. Ensure yaw system is enabled and receiving wind direction data.
2. Visually inspect yaw motors, gearboxes, and brake for damage or obstructions
3. Check yaw encoder for proper calibration and functionality.  
4. Run yaw system diagnostics to isolate issue to components.
5. Replace yaw motors, gearboxes, brakes, encoders as needed.

### Physical Damage Assessment & Repair

**Ice Damage**
Ice buildup on turbine blades can cause imbalance and damage if left unchecked. At first sign of ice, the turbine must be shut down and the blades de-iced. Follow approved de-icing procedures to safely remove ice. Once ice is removed, a full inspection of blades, hub, and other components should be performed to check for cracks or other damage from ice shedding. If damage is found, follow blade repair or replacement procedures.
