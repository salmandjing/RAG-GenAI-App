## Pre-Operation Inspection

Before operating a forklift, the operator must perform a thorough pre-operation inspection:

1. Check all fluid levels (engine oil, transmission fluid, hydraulic oil, battery water).
2. Inspect the tires for proper inflation, tread depth, and any damage.
3. Visually inspect the forks, mast, chains, and hydraulic cylinders for any cracks, damage, or leaks.
4. Ensure the overhead guard, seatbelt, and other safety features are in good working order.
5. Test the brakes, steering, and all control functions to verify proper operation.
6. Check the fuel/battery level and refuel/recharge as needed.
7. Identify any issues and report them to a supervisor before attempting to operate the forklift.

## Safe Forklift Operation

Forklift operators must be properly trained, authorized, and follow these safe operating procedures:

1. **Mounting/Dismounting**
   - Use the designated step and handhold when mounting and dismounting the forklift.
   - Ensure the parking brake is engaged before exiting the vehicle.

2. **Driving and Maneuvering**
   - Travel with the forks lowered 6-12 inches above the ground.
   - Drive at a safe speed appropriate for the load and environment.
   - Sound the horn when approaching blind corners or intersections.
   - Avoid sudden stops, turns, or direction changes that could cause the forklift to tip.
   - Travel in reverse if the load obstructs the forward view.

3. **Lifting and Transporting Loads**
   - Center the load evenly on the forks, not exceeding the rated capacity.
   - Lift the load smoothly and avoid sudden, jerky movements.
   - Travel with the load tilted back and the forks as low as possible.
   - Keep the load stable and avoid traveling with the forks raised.

4. **Parking and Shutdown**
   - Park the forklift on a level surface and apply the parking brake.
   - Lower the forks to the ground and turn off the engine/power.
   - Remove the key and complete any required logbooks or checklists.

## Operator Training and Certification

Only trained and authorized personnel are permitted to operate forklifts in this facility. Operators must:

- Complete a forklift certification course by a qualified instructor.
- Demonstrate proficiency in the pre-operation inspection and safe operating procedures.
- Receive site-specific training on the unique features and hazards of the facility.
- Maintain valid operator's licenses and participate in regular refresher training.

Supervisors are responsible for ensuring all forklift operators are properly certified and adhere to safety protocols at all times.

## Emergency Procedures

In the event of an accident or forklift malfunction, operators must take the following actions:

1. **Remain Calm and Assess the Situation**
   - Determine if there are any injuries or immediate hazards.
   - Secure the area and prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Report the Incident**
   - Contact the supervisor and emergency response teams as needed.

3. **Provide First Aid (if trained)**
   - Administer basic first aid to any injured personnel.
   - Do not move injured persons unless absolutely necessary.

4. **Isolate and Secure the Forklift**
   - Park the forklift in a safe location and apply the parking brake.
   - Turn off the engine/power and remove the key.

5. **Cooperate with Investigations**
   - Provide information and assistance to supervisors and investigators.
   - Do not attempt to operate the forklift or disturb the incident scene.

Comprehensive emergency response and incident reporting procedures are outlined in the facility's safety manual. All operators must be familiar with these protocols.
